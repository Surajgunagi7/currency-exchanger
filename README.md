# Currency Convertor
A **React** project using **vite** which implements the live updated currency conversion with over 150 currency support.

### About the Project
Here are some of the features/usability involved in the project
- **Scalability of the code**. Although it is not production grade, but it was kept in mind while designing the codebase.
- **Dynamistic of the response**. The result could have been obtain multiplying the hardcoded values, but instead it uses API to give most recent and latest values.
- **Use of the custom react Hooks**. It uses a custom react hook to get the response from the API. *Feel free to use the hook.*
